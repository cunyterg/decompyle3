Usage:
  {0} [OPTIONS]... FILE
  {0} [--help | -h | -V | --version]

Disassemble/Tokenize FILE with in the way that is done to assist
decompyle3 in parsing the instruction stream. For example instructions
with variable-length arguments like CALL_FUNCTION and BUILD_LIST have
argument counts appended to the instruction name, and COME_FROM pseudo
instructions are inserted into the instruction stream.  Bit flag
values encoded in an operand are expanding, EXTENDED_ARG value are
folded into the following instruction operand.

Like the parser, you may find this more high-level and or helpful.
However if you want a true disassembler see the Standard built-in
Python library module "dis", or pydisasm from the cross-version
Python bytecode package "xdis".

Examples:
  {0} foo.pyc
  {0} foo.py    # same thing as above but find the file
  {0} foo.pyc bar.pyc  # disassemble foo.pyc and bar.pyc

See also `pydisasm' from the `xdis' package.

Options:
  -V | --version     show version and stop
  -h | --help        show this message
