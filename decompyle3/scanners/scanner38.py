        Some transformations are made to assist the deparsing grammar:
           -  various types of LOAD_CONST's are categorized in terms of what they load
           -  COME_FROM instructions are added to assist parsing control structures
           -  operands with stack argument counts or flag masks are appended to the opcode name, e.g.:
              *  BUILD_LIST, BUILD_SET
              *  MAKE_FUNCTION and FUNCTION_CALLS append the number of positional arguments
           -  EXTENDED_ARGS instructions are removed

        Also, when we encounter certain tokens, we add them to a set which will cause custom
        grammar rules. Specifically, variable arg tokens like MAKE_FUNCTION or BUILD_LIST
        cause specific rules for the specific number of arguments they take.
